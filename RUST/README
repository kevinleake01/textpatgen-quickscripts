Getting started with Rust.

Although you can compile basic Rust programs using rustc, there will be times when
you will be getting involved with Cargo and Crates. If your program contains Crate
imports, you will need to set up a project.

Let's now have an example using the Text Pattern QuickScript file "tpl-0001.rs".

1: Create a new project called tpl-0001:

$ cargo new tpl-0001

2: Move "tpl-0001.rs" into the project, renaming it as "main.rs":

$ mv tpl-0001.rs tpl-0001/main.rs

3: Go into the tpl-0001 directory:

$ cd tpl-0001

4: Build and Run the program:

$ cargo build
$ cargo run

With luck, you should have your newly created Text Pattern QuickScipt generated text file,
starting with "00_".

A further example of using Cargo and Crates will be necessary if random number generation
is to be used. Here we will install the crate "rand" into the project:

$ cargo install rand
